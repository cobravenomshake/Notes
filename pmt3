So far, I have covered the following domains based on the controls listed in the provided Excel file:

1. **Anti-Malware**:
   - Control: Application of latest antivirus product version
   - Assessed against NIST, CIS, and ISO standards.

2. **Web Filtering**:
   - Control: Authorization of website access
   - Assessed against NIST, CIS, and ISO standards.

3. **IT Service Continuity Management (ITSCM)**:
   - Control: Availability of Service Continuity Plans for all services
   - Assessed against NIST, CIS, and ISO standards.

4. **Vulnerability Identification and Management**:
   - Control: Completeness of ICV Scanning Tool coverage
   - Control: Completeness of the Accelerated Penetration Testing Coverage
   - Assessed against NIST, CIS, and ISO standards.

The domains and controls reviewed are listed in the assessment template, with mappings and assessments for each control against the NIST, CIS, and ISO standards. Here’s a summary of the coverage so far:

### Summary of Domains Covered

1. **Anti-Malware**:
   - Application of latest antivirus product version

2. **Web Filtering**:
   - Authorization of website access

3. **IT Service Continuity Management (ITSCM)**:
   - Availability of Service Continuity Plans for all services

4. **Vulnerability Identification and Management**:
   - Completeness of ICV Scanning Tool coverage
   - Completeness of the Accelerated Penetration Testing Coverage

### Steps to Complete the Review

1. **Identify if there are any other domains** in the provided file that have not been reviewed yet.
2. **Review the remaining controls** in those domains.
3. **Map and assess each control** against the relevant NIST, CIS, and ISO standards.
4. **Document the assessments**.

Let's verify if there are any other domains and controls in the provided Excel file that need to be reviewed. I will display the full list of controls from the file to ensure all domains are covered.

The provided Excel file includes a diverse set of domains beyond those previously covered. Here is the list of additional domains identified:

1. **Network Security Management**
2. **Data Leakage Prevention**
3. **Secure Configuration Management**
4. **Cryptography**
5. **Information Security Awareness and Training**
6. **Security Incident Response and Management**
7. **Information Classification**
8. **Security Patch Management**
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring**
10. **Mobile Device Security Standard**
11. **Business Continuity Management Standard**
12. **Digital Certificate Management**
13. **Applications Security**
14. **Data Storage and Backup**
15. **Security in Interaction with Third Parties**
16. **Crisis Management Standard**
17. **Identity and Access Management**

To ensure a comprehensive review, I will proceed with assessing each of these additional domains against the relevant NIST, CIS, and ISO standards. I'll start with "Network Security Management" and continue sequentially.

### Detailed Assessment of Additional Domains

#### Network Security Management
1. **Control Name**: (Assuming a sample control for illustration)
   - **Control Description**: (Description of the control)
   - **NIST Mapping**: (Relevant NIST control)
   - **CIS Mapping**: (Relevant CIS control)
   - **ISO Mapping**: (Relevant ISO control)
   - **Assessment**: (Assessment based on description and mapping)

#### Data Leakage Prevention
2. **Control Name**: (Assuming a sample control for illustration)
   - **Control Description**: (Description of the control)
   - **NIST Mapping**: (Relevant NIST control)
   - **CIS Mapping**: (Relevant CIS control)
   - **ISO Mapping**: (Relevant ISO control)
   - **Assessment**: (Assessment based on description and mapping)

...and so on for each domain.

Let's start with the first additional domain, "Network Security Management," and review the controls provided in the Excel file.

It seems like I can’t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

For now, you can help by manually listing the controls from the additional domains in the Excel file. Once listed, I can continue to provide assessments for each control against the NIST, CIS, and ISO standards. Let me know how you would like to proceed!
