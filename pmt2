Let's review all the controls listed in the provided Excel file to ensure a thorough assessment. Here's a structured plan to review each control against the NIST, CIS, and ISO standards:

1. **List all the controls** from the provided file.
2. **Map each control** to the relevant NIST, CIS, and ISO standards.
3. **Evaluate each control** to determine its compliance with the mapped standards.
4. **Document the assessments** for each control.

I'll start by reviewing all the controls in the Excel file and mapping them to the appropriate standards. Then, I'll provide detailed assessments for each control.

   - **NIST Mapping**: RA-5 (Vulnerability Scanning)
   - **CIS Mapping**: Control 3 (Continuous Vulnerability Management)
   - **ISO Mapping**: A.12.6.1 (Technical Vulnerability Management)

### Detailed Assessment of Each Control

I will now complete the detailed assessment for each control, similar to the previous examples, ensuring all controls from the Excel file are covered.

#### Control 1: Application of Latest Antivirus Product Version
- **NIST**: SI-3 (Malicious Code Protection)
  - **Assessment**: Partially Compliant - Updates are mentioned, but periodic scans and deployment details are missing.
- **CIS**: Control 8 (Malware Defenses)
  - **Assessment**: Fully Compliant - Aligns with keeping antivirus updated.
- **ISO**: A.12.2 (Protection from Malware)
  - **Assessment**: Partially Compliant - Lacks details on detection, prevention, and user awareness.

#### Control 2: Authorization of Website Access
- **NIST**: AC-4 (Information Flow Enforcement)
  - **Assessment**: Partially Compliant - Lacks details on enforcement and continuous monitoring.
- **CIS**: Control 7 (Web Browsing Protections)
  - **Assessment**: Fully Compliant - Aligns with whitelisting websites.
- **ISO**: A.12.6.2 (Technical Vulnerability Management)
  - **Assessment**: Partially Compliant - Lacks broader vulnerability management aspects.

#### Control 3: Availability of Service Continuity Plans for All Services
- **NIST**: CP-9 (Information System Backup)
  - **Assessment**: Partially Compliant - Availability mentioned, but not the regular testing and updates of plans.
- **CIS**: Control 10 (Data Recovery Capabilities)
  - **Assessment**: Partially Compliant - Similar to NIST, lacks details on testing and updates.
- **ISO**: A.17 (Information Security Aspects of Business Continuity Management)
  - **Assessment**: Partially Compliant - Should include more details on ISMS and continuity plans.

#### Control 4: Completeness of ICV Scanning Tool Coverage
- **NIST**: RA-5 (Vulnerability Scanning)
  - **Assessment**: Partially Compliant - Scanning is covered but lacks analysis and remediation details.
- **CIS**: Control 3 (Continuous Vulnerability Management)
  - **Assessment**: Partially Compliant - Continuous acquisition and action on new vulnerabilities missing.
- **ISO**: A.12.6.1 (Technical Vulnerability Management)
  - **Assessment**: Partially Compliant - Broader measures to prevent exploitation are missing.

#### Control 5: Completeness of the Accelerated Penetration Testing Coverage
- **NIST**: RA-5 (Vulnerability Scanning)
  - **Assessment**: Partially Compliant - Reconciliation is good, but details on scanning, analysis, and remediation are needed.
- **CIS**: Control 3 (Continuous Vulnerability Management)
  - **Assessment**: Partially Compliant - Reconciliation covered but lacks continuous action on new vulnerabilities.
- **ISO**: A.12.6.1 (Technical Vulnerability Management)
  - **Assessment**: Partially Compliant - Broader measures to prevent exploitation are missing.

#### Control 6: Completeness of ICV Scanning Tool Coverage (Duplicate)
- **NIST**: RA-5 (Vulnerability Scanning)
  - **Assessment**: Same as Control 4.
- **CIS**: Control 3 (Continuous Vulnerability Management)
  - **Assessment**: Same as Control 4.
- **ISO**: A.12.6.1 (Technical Vulnerability Management)
  - **Assessment**: Same as Control 4.

### Summary

- **Anti-Malware**: Controls partially meet NIST and ISO requirements but are fully compliant with CIS standards.
- **Web Filtering**: Controls are fully compliant with CIS but partially meet NIST and ISO requirements.
- **IT Service Continuity Management**: Controls partially meet all standards.
- **Vulnerability Identification and Management**: Controls partially meet all standards.

This comprehensive review ensures that each control in the provided Excel file is assessed against NIST, CIS, and ISO standards. If you need further details or specific recommendations for achieving full compliance, please let me know.
