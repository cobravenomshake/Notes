Network Security Management,Completeness of network intrusion detection system coverage on external network channels.,All network channels based on firewalls that route network traffic in the Bank (internal traffic) and between the Bank and external networks (external traffic). Network channel inventory is created and enhanced every time when new firewall is deployed during Firewall Security Acceptance Testing process. All identified external network channels are covered by network intrusion detection system capabilities as a part of this process. Network traffic controlled by new firewall is redirected to new or existing Link aggregator or NIDS sensor and further passed to network intrusion detection system appliance to ensure NIDS capability if required.

The recertification is performed to verify if RMP access is still required.

The above control is executed based on the following outcomes:
CSS-DP RMP governance team ensures that approval is granted for retaining RMP access for another 6 months. If approval is not provided, the CSS-DP- RMP Governance team raises appropriate service request via SRM to revoke the removable media access in-line with the expiry date.
